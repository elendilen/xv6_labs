### This is my summary of lab1-util
#### It is quite difficult at first,especially the lab primes--took me a long time without success.However,I got more familiar with the all sort of things in xv6(a super concise version of unix).
+ sleep,easy as pie.just call the system call
+ pingpong,a bit difficult at first--I am not a fan of pipe.
+ primes,omg,took me ages to implement,sadly without success.I think the problem is that I didn't use the system call dup and ran the system out of file discriptors.
+ find,did it all by myself.Feels great!
+ xargs.The funny thing is some mistakes in the previous lab find made the pipe won't work.Solve it in the end of course.
